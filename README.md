# README-Generator

This is a command line application which is used to generate a professional and complete README for devs to use on their projects. This application simplifies the process of completing a README by asking pre-generated questions that apply to the contents of a README. The dev can then build a README by answering a few simple questions, rather than writing their own, or using a pre-written template.
